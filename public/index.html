      I like video games!
    </h1>
    <h2>
      (even though I never finish any)
    </h2>
    <p>
      I like open-world adventure games, action-adventure games, platform fighting games, 
      grid-based tactical strategy games, metroidvanias, and some 
      simulation games

      Videogames are neat because they exist at an intersection 
      between music, theater, sports, and the visual arts. By
       combining aspects of all these different fields, 
       videogames create an experience that no ther medium can. 
       I'm really bad at staying focused and finishing games but 
       I still have a great time with them.
